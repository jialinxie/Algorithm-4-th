####1.1.25  Use mathematical induction to prove that Euclidâ€™s algorithm computes the greatest common divisor of any pair of nonnegative integers p and q.

- ### Correctness Proof

  Let us prove its correctness by induction over $N$, the number of recursive calls:

  - **Base case:** $N = 0$. In this case it must be $b = 0$, and therefore $(a, b) = (a, 0) = a$. So the algorithm returns the right value.
  - **Inductive case:** Let $a$ and $b$ be such that $euclid(a, b)$ make $N$ recursive calls, with $N \gt 0$. Let $q$ and $r$ be the quotient and the remainder of dividing $a$ into $b$, so that $a = qb + r$ and $0 \le r \lt b$. As $r = a % b$, the precodition ($a \ge 0, b \ge 0$) of the recursive call $euclid(b, a % b)$ holds. Further, $(a, b) = (b, a) = (b, qb + r) = (b, r)$. So by the inductive hypothesis the algorithm returns the right value.

  For any pair of nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$, the algorithm is bound to terminate since every new step generates a similar problem (that of finding the *greatest common divisor*) for a pair of smaller integers.
